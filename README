#Netcat File Transfer
-----------------------

Description:

The code contains two primary functions in netcat_part.cpp file namely, netcatServer() and netcatClient().

Based on the values of the commandline arguments, one of the functions is invoked.

The netcatClient() function sends data in batch of 1024 bytes which consists of a part of the actual message 
and a digest of constant size.

The netcatServer() function receives data in batch of 1024 bytes consisting of the message/data and digest.
Additionally this function splits the message and the client digest, generates its own digest and compares it
with the client digest. If the digests match, the received data is written to a file.

------------------------------

Tasks accomplished:

 *   A message string provided as a commandline argument and enclosed within "" along with its HMAC digest is sent 
     to the server.

 *  A file whose name is given as a command line argument is sent to the server. Also, the user has an option to send
    a file partially by giving the number of bytes(n) to send and/or offset(o) from where the bytes should be sent.
    A digest is calculated and sent with the file content using HMAC function.

 *  The user has an option to activate verbose mode.

 *  If no port number is mentioned default port is used i.e. 6767.

 * The server receives the message along with the digest sent and then calculates its own digest to assure whether the
   message is the one that was sent by the client. If the the digests match, the output is written to a file else, the program is
   is terminated.

--------------------------------

Steps to compile and run:

1. Navigate to the directory where the makefile and the source code file is present. Make sure they are present at the same
   location.

2. Type make and hit enter. Step 1 and 2 to be followed on both client and server machines.

3. If no error is displayed, that means the code has compiled successfully.

4. Type the following command to start a server instance:
   ./netcat_part -l [-v] [-p portno] hostaddress output.txt

5. Type the following command to start a client instance:
   ./netcat_part [-v] [-p portno] -m "message" hostaddress, incase of message mode.
   or
   ./netcat_part [-v] [-p portno] [-n noofbytes] [-o offset] hostaddress filename

6  If the data is sent successfully, the data is written to output.txt file, success message is displayed and the program is 
   exited. In case of error appropriate error message will be displayed.
